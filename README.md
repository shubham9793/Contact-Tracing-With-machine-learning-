# Contact-Tracing-With-machine-learning-

This project in ‘Python’, “Contact Tracing with Machine Learning”. this is 
unsupervised machine learning. Contact tracing is the name of the process used to 
identify those who come into contact with people who have tested positive for 
contagious diseases — such as measles, HIV, and COVID-19. During a pandemic, 
performing contact tracing correctly can help reduce the number of people to get 
infected or speed up the process of treating infected people. Doing so can help save 
many lives.
The dataset I will be using consists of 4 columns/attributes namely: id, timestamp, 
latitude, and longitude. You can get the data from https://www.kaggle.com/
In the case of manual contact tracing, health authorities directly interact with the 
diagnosed COVID-19 patient to record their recent visits to the places they had 
been. They will also try to identify other people who were present with the patient.
Whereas in the case of digital contact tracing, the authorities will be able to mine 
the location history of the patient in order to identify if the patient has potentially 
infected anyone.
In this project we are developing a machine learning model which is help to find 
that person which effected by a covid19 patient.
